cache_plot is a basic frontend for johnny cache  -- http://packages.python.org/johnny-cache/
It currently uses mongo_db to log a counter per table and per page path for hits/misses.

To install:
Add urls.py to your main urls.py:

    (r'^plot/', include('cache_plot.urls')),

Add (appname).cache_plot.middleware.CachePlotMiddleware to your MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES

Install mongo_db (http://www.mongodb.org) and run 

Optional settings:
CACHE_PLOT_HOST: string host mongo is running on. default='localhost'
CACHE_PLOT_PORT: port mongo is running on. default=27017
CACHE_PLOT_DB: database to connect to. default='cache_plot'
CACHE_PLOT_TABLE_BUCKET: tables bucket. default='tables_aggr'
CACHE_PLOT_REQUEST_BUCKET: tables bucket. default='request_aggr'

In the future I would like to change the default resolution back to days, 
and perhaps make an aggregator if there are too many entries. 

I would also like to default the pages and to a searchable/sortable
lazy loading ajax table, though that diminishes some of the 
simplicity of the current app, so the direction is undecided.

This has not been tested in a production environment on a high
load host. The current aggregated version will log every request
path including GET parameters, so the log size could be
 large.
